/*
* Go by Example: Hello World
  gobyexample.com
  
  Our first program will print the classic "hello world" message. The source code is above.

  To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.

  Sometimes you'll want to build the program into binaries. We can do thsi using go build.
  We can then execute the built binaries directly.

  Now that we can run and build basic Go programs, let's learn more about the language.
  Next lesson: values.go
