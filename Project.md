# How to Launch a New Golang Project

## Step 1: Install Go
Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Step 2: Set Up Your Workspace
Create a directory for your new project. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
mkdir my-golang-project
cd my-golang-project
```

## Step 3: Initialize a New Go Module
Run the following command to initialize a new Go module:

```sh
go mod init github.com/your-username/my-golang-project
```

This will create a `go.mod` file in your project directory.

## Step 4: Write Your Code
Create a new Go file (e.g., `main.go`) and start writing your code.

## Step 5: Build Your Project
To build your project, run the following command:

```sh
go build
```

This will compile your code and generate an executable file.

## Step 6: Run Your Project

To run your project, use the following command:

```sh
./my-golang-project
```

That's it! You have successfully launched a new Golang project.
```

## Example Go Program

Here is an example Go program that prints "Hello, World!":

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

To run this program, save it to a file (e.g., `hello.go`) and run the following command:

```sh
go run hello.go
```

This will compile and run the program, and you should see the output `Hello, World!` in your terminal.

## Development
There is a tool called air for Go that can automatically reload your application when you make changes to your code. It is similar to nodemon in Node.js.

To install air, run the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

After installing air, you can create a configuration file named .air.toml in your project directory to customize the behavior of air. Here is an example configuration:

```toml
# .air.toml
[build]
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
  bin = "./tmp/main"
  full_bin = "APP_ENV=dev APP_USER=air ./tmp/main"
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor"]
  exclude_file = ["*_test.go"]
  exclude_regex = ["^/tmp/"]
  delay = 1000 # ms
  stop_on_error = true
  kill_signal = "kill"
  kill_timeout = 1000 # ms

[log]
  level = "debug"
  color = true
  timestamp = false

[serve]
  watch_dir = ["."]
  watch_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  ignore_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor"]
  ignore_file = ["*_test.go"]
  ignore_regex = ["^/tmp/"]
  bin = "./tmp/main"
  cmd = "APP_ENV=dev APP_USER=air ./tmp/main"
  delay = 1000 # ms
  grace = 1000 # ms
  kill_signal = "kill"
  kill_timeout = 1000 # ms
```

To start your application with air, run the following command:

```sh
air
```

air will watch for changes in your Go files and automatically reload your application when changes are detected.

- air: Description: air is a live reloading tool for Go applications. It watches for changes in your Go files and automatically rebuilds and restarts your application. Best Use: Use air if you need a straightforward and easy-to-configure tool for live reloading during development. It is particularly useful for web applications and services where you need to see changes immediately.
- reflex: Description: reflex is a small tool that watches a directory and reruns a command when files change. It is highly configurable and can be used for various tasks beyond just Go development.  Best Use: Use reflex if you need a flexible and lightweight tool that can be configured to watch specific files or directories and run custom commands. It is suitable for projects where you need more control over what actions are taken on file changes.
- fresh: Description: fresh is a command line tool that automatically reloads your Go application when it changes. It is simple to set up and use.  Best Use: Use fresh if you want a minimalistic and easy-to-use tool for live reloading. It is ideal for small to medium-sized projects where you need quick feedback on code changes.
- realize: Description: realize is a Go build system with file watchers, live reload, and more. It offers advanced features like task management and custom workflows.  Best Use: Use realize if you need a more comprehensive build system with advanced features. It is suitable for larger projects where you need to manage complex build processes and workflows.

- Each tool has its own strengths, so you can choose the one that best fits your development workflow and project requirements.


As a veteran Go developer, there are several best practices and tips you can follow throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure your project is well-structured, maintainable, and efficient. Here are some key points:  
Project Structure:  
Follow a standard project layout. A common structure is:
├── cmd/
│   └── yourapp/
│       └── main.go
├── pkg/
│   └── yourlib/
│       └── yourlib.go
├── internal/
│   └── yourinternalpkg/
│       └── yourinternalpkg.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── README.md

Dependency Management:  
Use go.mod and go.sum for dependency management. Keep them updated and tidy using go mod tidy.

Code Quality:  
Write tests for your code. Use testing package and aim for good test coverage.
Use linters like golangci-lint to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early.
Format your code using gofmt or goimports.

Documentation:  
Document your code using comments. Follow Go's conventions for package-level, function-level, and type-level comments.
Maintain a README.md file with clear instructions on how to build, run, and test your project.

Version Control:  
Use a version control system like Git. Follow best practices for commit messages and branching strategies.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):  
Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment of your application. Tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI can be useful.

Performance and Profiling:  
Use Go's built-in profiling tools (pprof) to analyze and optimize the performance of your application.

Error Handling:  
Handle errors gracefully and consistently. Use Go's error handling idioms and consider using packages like pkg/errors for more context.

Concurrency:  
Leverage Go's concurrency model with goroutines and channels. Ensure proper synchronization and avoid common pitfalls like race conditions.

Security:  
Follow security best practices. Regularly review dependencies for vulnerabilities and keep them up to date.
By adhering to these practices, you can ensure that your Go projects are robust, maintainable, and scalable.

One of the top linting tools for Go is golangci-lint. It is a fast and flexible linter that aggregates multiple linters into a single tool. Here’s how you can install and configure golangci-lint for your booking-app project:
```sh
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```
Create a configuration file: Create a .golangci.yml file in the root of your booking-app project directory with the following content:  
```yaml
linters:
  enable:
    - errcheck
    - gosimple
    - govet
    - ineffassign
    - staticcheck
    - structcheck
    - typecheck
    - unused
    - varcheck

run:
  timeout: 5m

issues:
  exclude-rules:
    - path: _test\.go
      linters:
        - errcheck
```

Usage
Run golangci-lint:
golangci-lint run


## Go vs Node.js
Go and Node.js have different strengths and are suited for different types of projects. Here are some scenarios where one might be preferred over the other:  
Go
Recommended for:  
High-performance applications
CPU-bound tasks
Applications requiring efficient concurrency (e.g., network servers, web servers)
Microservices architecture
Systems programming
Not recommended for:  
Projects requiring a large number of third-party libraries and frameworks (Node.js has a richer ecosystem)
Rapid prototyping and development (Node.js might be faster due to JavaScript's flexibility and familiarity)
Node.js
Recommended for:  
I/O-bound tasks (e.g., real-time applications, chat applications)
Web development with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
Rapid prototyping and development
Applications requiring a non-blocking, event-driven architecture
Not recommended for:  
CPU-bound tasks (Node.js might struggle with performance compared to Go)
Applications requiring high concurrency and performance (Go's goroutines are more efficient)
The choice between Go and Node.js depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
