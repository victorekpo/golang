
Our first program will print the classic “hello world” message. Here’s the full source code.


To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.

Sometimes we’ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.

We can then execute the built binary directly.


Go has various value types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, etc. Here are a few basic examples.
Strings, which can be added together with +.
Integers and floats.
Booleans, with boolean operators as you’d expect.


In Go, variables are explicitly declared and used by the compiler to e.g. check type-correctness of function calls.
var declares 1 or more variables.
You can declare multiple variables at once.
Go will infer the type of initialized variables.
Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are zero-valued. For example, the zero value for an int is 0.
The := syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable, e.g. for var f string = "apple" in this case. This syntax is only available inside functions. f := "apple"
